sed command --> sed 's/madhu/madhukiran/' test > test2

Replaces occurrences of a pattern with a specified replacement.
Syntax: s/pattern/replacement/flags

sed 's/madhu/madhukiran/' input.txt     # Replace first occurrence of 'madhu' with 'madhukiran' in each line
sed 's/madhu/madhukiran/g' input.txt    # Replace all occurrences of 'madhu' with 'madhukiran' in each line
sed 's/madhu/madhukiran/2' input.txt    # Replace the second occurrence of ''madhu' with 'madhukiran' in each line

df (disk free or disk filesystem) 
df -h 
df -m 

In Windows, drives such as C:, D:, and E: are logical designations assigned to storage devices or partitions. Each drive letter represents a separate filesystem namespace, allowing users and applications to access files and directories on that specific storage unit. 


In Linux, the concept of drive letters like C:, D:, and E: does not exist. Instead, Linux uses a single hierarchical directory structure that begins at the root directory (/). All storage devices, partitions, and network filesystems are integrated into this hierarchy by mounting them at specific directories

chmod (FILE PERMISSIONS) 

The chmod command in Linux is used to change the file permissions. Permissions dictate who can read, write, or execute a file. Here's a comprehensive guide on using the chmod command:


There are three types of users:

u – the file owner (user)
g – the group to which the file belongs
o – others
a – all (user, group, and others)

------------------
object :  madhu 

owner/user    |  group  | others 

rwx               rwx     rwx 

r - read - 4
w - write - 2
x - execute - 1 


Modes
Modes can be specified using symbolic or numeric (octal) notation.

Symbolic Notation
r – read permission
w – write permission
x – execute permission



Numeric (Octal) Notation
4 – read permission
2 – write permission
1 – execute permission

The numeric mode is a combination of these values. For example:

7 – read, write, and execute (4 + 2 + 1)
6 – read and write (4 + 2)
5 – read and execute (4 + 1)
4 – read only


rwx |r-x | r-x. 2 root root        6 Apr  4 14:05 javadir
rw- |r-- | r--. 1 root root     5562 Apr  8 13:48 linux

rwx ---  ---. 1 root root     5562 Apr  8 13:48 linux

rw- -w- --x. 1 root root     5562 Apr  8 13:48 linux


o/u - full 
g -  rw 
ot - wx

chmod -R 

================================================
CHOWN :
FILE & DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP :

The chown command in Linux is used to change the ownership of files and directories. This command allows you to change both the user and group ownership of a file or directory.

chown [options] user[:group] file(s)

1. Change the Owner of a File:

      chown newuser filename
	  
2. Change the Group of a File:
	  
	  chown :newgroup filename

3.Change Both the Owner and Group of a File:
     
	  chown newuser:newgroup filename
	  
4. Change the Owner and Group of Multiple Files:

     chown newuser:newgroup file1 file2 file3


5.-R – Change ownership recursively for directories and their contents:
chown -R newuser:newgroup /path/to/directory
